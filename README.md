# Gapstar's Tech Lead (React/Node) Assessment 

## üìù Advanced TODO List Assignment

### Rules:
- Code should be located in a repository (For instance: GitLab).
- Implement the project using React.js (Frontend) and Node.js | Express (Backend).
- Use TypeScript for both frontend and backend.
- Feel free to use any state management library or additional packages.
- Design your own UI/UX.
- Demonstrate and reveal all your knowledge in project implementation.
- Code should follow best practices and include unit tests.

### Frontend (React.js + TypeScript)
‚úÖ Implement a TODO list with the following features:
- Users can add, delete, update, and search tasks.
- Each task has a title, status (done/not done), and priority (Low/Medium/High).
- Tasks should be sortable by priority or status. ‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Users can create recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly). ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Users can define dependencies between tasks (e.g., Task A cannot be completed
before Task B). ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### Backend (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
‚úÖ Implement a REST API to support the frontend, including:
- Adding, deleting, updating tasks.
- Searching and filtering tasks by status, priority. ‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Handling recurring tasks logic (auto-create at scheduled intervals). ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Enforcing task dependencies (e.g., Task A must be completed before Task B).
